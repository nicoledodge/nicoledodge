Hey Iâ€™m Nicole! (some people call me Nikki) 
  
Iâ€™m new to the world of web development but have been no stranger to technology. Expertised in DSLR camera processes and Adobe applications, my profession prior to computers involved Wedding & Festival Photography, as well as the team photographer for a Division I football team. I spend most of my time at festivals and traveling across different national parks and different countries! Always looking for a new adventure and not afraid to ask why.
